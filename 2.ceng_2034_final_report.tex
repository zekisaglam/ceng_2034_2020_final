The purpose of this assignment is to understand child and parent relationships and use multiprocessing.
method.I downloaded
some files with the function using child process from a given Array list.

\section{Introduction}
This Assessment I compared many types of processes.I learned how to use it. 

\section{Assignments}
I started this task by taking the necessary libraries.

\subsection*{2.1. For Print parent id }

Print parent id to screen.Create child process using fork.If pid of process is greater than 0 that means it is parent process.os.wait() method is used by a process to wait for completion of a child process.
If pid of process is equal to 0 that means it is child process.Print child id to screen.

\subsection*{2.2With the child process, downloading the files via the given Array list}
Requests.get method makes a request to a url, and return the status code. If status code equal to 200 that means url is working. 

 Create a file named fille name. 
 Print information and file name after that Print if url was not downloaded, and check for duplicates.The elements registered in the a list were checked with the multiprocess technique and the duplicate

\subsection*{2.3 Avoiding the orphan process situation}

This time the problem was avoiding the orphan process situation. I added wait() for this, after
the child but before the parent because I wanted my parent process to wait child to complete.We created child proccesses and with ”os.wait()” methods , avoid from orphan processes.


\section{Results}
I got this output showing parent and child pids.
It shows a list of downloaded files, the pids of the processes in the functions, duplicate files list and taken time.

\section{Conclusion}

I learned a lot with this task. One of the first things I learned; in multiprocessing, multiple processes or jobs can be run and managed by the CPU or a single program. 
This Assignment was very instructive and made me understand how processes work.
